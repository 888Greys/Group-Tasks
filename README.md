# Student Details Web Application

This is a simple Flask-based web application that allows users to submit student details (first name, last name, email, and phone number) through an HTML form. The entered details are then displayed in a table format on the same page. The app also includes a home page that acts as a switchboard for navigating to other pages.

## Features
- Submit student details via a form.
- Display entered student details in an HTML table.
- Responsive design that adjusts well on mobile devices.
- Simple and attractive user interface with a gradient background.
- Interactive buttons with navigation links (back to the home page).

## Prerequisites
Before running the application, make sure you have the following installed on your local machine:

- Python 3.8 or above
- Flask (`pip install flask`)
- HTML, CSS, and JavaScript for the front-end

## Installation

### Clone the repository
To get started, first clone the project from GitHub:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/your-repository-name.git
cd your-repository-name
```

### Create a Virtual Environment
It's recommended to use a virtual environment for installing dependencies. Run the following commands to set it up:

1. Create a virtual environment:
   ```bash
   python -m venv cat2
   ```

2. Activate the virtual environment:
   - On **Windows**:
     ```bash
     .\cat2\Scripts\activate
     ```
   - On **Mac/Linux**:
     ```bash
     source cat2/bin/activate
     ```

### Install Dependencies
Once the virtual environment is active, install the necessary Python packages:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Running the Application

To run the Flask application locally, use the following command:
```bash
python app.py
```

Your application will be running on [http://localhost:5000](http://localhost:5000).

## Application Overview

1. **Home Page (Landing Page)**:
   - This page serves as the switchboard for the application, where users can navigate to the "Student Details" page.
